# SimpleRadio
This mod adds a simple radio you can use to communicate with your friends while far away!

When holding right click on the radio, you will transmit your voice to other players in the same group.

Other functionality like proximity chat (should) remain the same.

NOTE: This requires you to enable 'open_groups' in the Simple Voice Chat configuration!
